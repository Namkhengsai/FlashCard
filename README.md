# FlashCard
## Introduction
This app is a project I built along the way during Paul Hudsonâ€™s 100DaysOfSwiftUI course.

## Overview
FlashCard is an app that allows users to create their own flashcards for learning purposes, enhancing their study experience through personalized content.

## Skills Learned
* Learned how to set a countdown timer in the app.
* Learned how to be notified when the app moves to the background to make the timer stop if the app goes into the background.

## Future Plan
* Allow users to create multiple sets of their flashcards.
* Refine the user interface for a better user experience.
* Enable users to share their flashcard sets with others through QR codes.
